    "Gmail filters are a really useful tool for automating the organization of your email. Let’s say that you get email receipts from Amazon and you don’t want those to hit your inbox each time you buy something. Using filters in Gmail, you can create rules to automatically mark those items as read and send them to the Archive, a certain label, or even delete them.\n",

    "Depending on how you configured the filter, you could include items you aren’t aware of in the filter. If you created a filter with the phrase Amazon and set it to automatically delete, you could be including a message from a coworker about something to do with Amazon in that filter. If you’re missing emails in Gmail, look to recover them by checking the filter. As a rule of advice, never create a filter to delete emails automatically. It’s always better to archive and mark as read. Once emails are deleted, it starts the countdown before the trash\n",

    "How To Recover Your Missing Gmail Emails\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve realized you’re missing Gmail emails, there are a few places you can look to see if you can recover them. Be sure to note the steps above on some reasons why they might be missing in action. Thankfully, Gmail offers a large storage tier for free accounts, so the reason your missing Gmail emails likely doesn’t have anything to do with being out of space.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Check Gmail Trash \n",
    "\n",
    "The first place to check when you’re missing Gmail emails is your Trash. On the sidebar, scroll till you find the trash folder. It’s possible you accidentally deleted an item or it was deleted by a filter. In that situation, you’ll likely find it in the trash. Gmail empties the trash every 30 days, so it’s a good idea to check it weekly to make sure you haven’t deleted anything important.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check Gmail Spam Folder \n",
    "\n",
    "Email spam is a complicated process as it’s possible that different people have different viewers of what spam is. Either way, if you are missing emails in Gmail, check the spam folder to see if it got automatically placed there. Gmail empties the folder every 30 days, so it’s wise to check it weekly and quickly scan to see if anything important landed in Spam.\n",

    "3. Check Gmail Archived Email Folder \n",
    "\n",
    "Gmail has a single Archive folder that’s designed to be a collection of all your Gmail email. Regardless of whether it’s inside your Inbox or tied to Gmail labels, the archive folder will house EVERYTHING. If you’re missing an email, look in the archive folder in Gmail.\n",

    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use Gmail Search to Find Missing Emails \n",
    "\n",
    "When in doubt, use Gmail’s powerful search function to find your missing Gmail emails. Search for any snippet of information that might be included in the email such as subject, name, etc. The search function can find information across your entire account.\n",

    "5. Use Gmail Recovery Tool \n",
    "\n",
    "As a last-ditch effort to recover deleted emails, Gmail offers a tool to recover deleted emails from the past 30 days. If the above four steps didn’t recover your messages, check out the Gmail recovery tool as a place to try as a final step.\n",
