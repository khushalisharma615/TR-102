    "some common approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications):**\n",
    "   - You can use VBA to automate tasks in Outlook, such as managing emails, calendar entries, and contacts.\n",
    "   - VBA can be accessed through the Outlook Developer tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "2Outlook Add-ins:\n",
    "   - You can develop add-ins using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with the Office Add-ins platform.\n",
    "   - These add-ins can extend Outlook functionalities and are distributed via the Office Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Outlook REST API and Microsoft Graph:*\n",
    "   - You can use the Outlook REST API or Microsoft Graph API to interact with Outlook data (emails, calendar, contacts) programmatically.\n",
    "   - These APIs can be accessed from various programming languages like Python, JavaScript, C#, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow):\n",
    "   - Power Automate allows you to create automated workflows between your apps and services, including Outlook.\n",
    "   - It provides a no-code/low-code environment to automate repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Sending an Email using VBA in Outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple VBA  to send an email:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Outlook and press `Alt + F11` to open the VBA editor.\n",
    "2. Insert a new module (`Insert > Module`) and add the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `YOUR_TENANT_ID` with your actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples should help you get started with coding for Outlook. If you have a specific use case in mind, feel free to share it!.\n",
    "Accessing the VBA Editor\n",
    "1.\tOpen the Developer Tab:\n",
    "o\tAfter enabling the Developer tab, you will see it in the Outlook ribbon.\n",
    "2.\tOpen the VBA Editor:\n",
    "o\tClick on the Developer tab.\n",
    "o\tIn the Code group, click on Visual Basic to open the VBA editor.\n",
    "Alternatively, you can press Alt + "
